# lotto-scraper
This scraper crawls on multiple sites and fetch lotto results to save to database. The scrapped data will then be displayed to a wordpress site or a mobile app.
I built this when I was doing some research on web scraping. Some might not work anymore due to outdated links in global.json.

The scraped results are posted here https://lottoresulta.com/
