Lotto Scraper is a versatile web scraping tool designed to gather lottery results from various websites and store them in a database. These scraped lottery results can then be seamlessly integrated into a WordPress website or a mobile app. I initially developed this project during my research on web scraping techniques, and while some scraping sources might no longer work due to changes in URLs, you can still find the scraped results on [LottoResulta](https://lottoresulta.com/).

## Features

- Scrape lottery results from multiple websites.
- Store scraped data in a database for easy access and analysis.
- Display the collected data on a WordPress website or a mobile app.
- Continuously updated results on [LottoResulta](https://lottoresulta.com/).

## Usage

To get started with Lotto Scraper, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the scraping sources in `global.json`.
3. Run the scraper to fetch the latest lottery results.
4. Integrate the data into your WordPress site or mobile app.

Please note that some scraping sources may no longer be functional due to outdated links in `global.json`. You may need to update the source URLs as necessary.
